This is a Turkish `name game`.

I've created this app with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)..

The specs of the project are: 

The computer says a name with a specific time period, after that, you have to say a name starting with the last character of the name that the computer said.And it goes like that. 
You can not say the same name.
The time period is 8 seconds.


## Install & Run

```
-yarn or npm install
-yarn start or npm start
-Access "localhost:3000"
```
